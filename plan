Step 1:

Contract that a person can send an amount with a specific message (message = "message") and deposit money
Same person needs to send a second message and get all the money returned to them

Step 2:
Include ability to display all the messages and money in browser, including past ones

Step 3:
Same as step 2, but another person can send a message(0 or 1) to the same contract, using the same question id
note, if the second message by question owner has been sent, this has to fail

Step 4: 
display the number of 0s and 1s sent
when the owner sends the second message recorde the amount of eth that each of the answeres have in the accounts at the moment

Step 5:
Instead of returning eth to the owner, return it to the answerers (including the owner, if they answered)

Step 6:
Make the plan for delegation
